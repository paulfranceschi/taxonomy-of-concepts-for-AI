# General considerations
The aim of this project is to create a library in Python based on a taxonomy of commonly used concepts, so that it can be used in projects related to artificial intelligence and natural language understanding.

## project history
This project was initiated by philosopher [Paul Franceschi](www.paulfranceschi.com) in February 2023.

# Software tools
Software tools are available for this project.

## code generator
The code generator creates python code for the relevant taxonomy of concepts. The code generator starts with a list of concepts organised in a 6-column table, and automatically and instantly generates the corresponding code. To generate this list of concepts, a simple .csv file can be used.

## corpus generator
This tool creates of corpus of citations, that can be used to train an AI.

# How to contribute?
You can contribute to the project by completing, enriching or correcting the dictionaries, or by participating in the development of the software tools associated with the project. The dictionaries are presented as .csv files, so that their structure is easily accessible and understandable without any specialised computer knowledge.

# A multilingual project
This project is intended to be multilingual and provides the tools for its extension to other languages. Endangered langugaes are especially welcome.

# License
