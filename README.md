# General considerations

## project history
This project was initiated by philosopher [Paul Franceschi](www.paulfranceschi.com) in February 2023.

# Software tools
Software tools (dictionary expander, conjugators, etc.) for:
- endangered languages
- major languages, in order to build the associated translation pairs: for example, italian-sassarese, french-corsican, etc.

## dictionary expander
Allows to create derived words from lemmas.

# How to contribute?
You can contribute to the project by completing, enriching or correcting the multilingual dictionary, or by participating in the development of the software tools associated with the project. The dictionary is presented as a .csv file, so that its structure is easily accessible and understandable without any specialised computer knowledge.
